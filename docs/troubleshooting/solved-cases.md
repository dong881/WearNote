# Solved Issues and Solutions

This document lists common issues that have been encountered during the development of WearNote and their solutions.

## Authentication Issues

### Google Sign-In Developer Error (Error Code 10)

**Issue:** Authentication fails with error code 10 (DEVELOPER_ERROR).

**Solution:**
- Verify that the SHA-1 fingerprint in Google Cloud Console matches the app's signing key
- Ensure the correct Android client ID is used from the Google Cloud Console
- Use only the Android client ID (not the Web client ID) for Android apps
- Make sure all required scopes are properly added

### OAuth Permission Handling

**Issue:** App doesn't show permission request when needed for Google Drive access.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `UserRecoverableAuthIOException` handling
- Added broadcast mechanism to communicate permission requirements
- Created permission request intent handling in the main activity

## Recording Issues

### Background Recording Stops

**Issue:** Recording stops when the app goes to the background.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a foreground service with proper notification
- Added `RECORD_AUDIO` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permissions
- Used `startForegroundService()` for Android O and above
- Added `android:foregroundServiceType="microphone"` in AndroidManifest.xml

### Pause/Resume Not Working Correctly

**Issue:** Pausing recording would stop using the microphone but the timer would continue.

**Solution:**
- Fixed pause/resume functionality to properly control the MediaRecorder
- Ensured microphone access is maintained during pause
- Corrected the recording state management

## Upload Issues

### Failed Uploads Not Retried

**Issue:** When uploads fail due to network issues, they were not being retried.

**Solution:**
- Created PendingUploadsManager to track failed uploads
- Implemented NetworkMonitorService to detect connectivity changes
- Added UI to view and manually retry failed uploads
- Stored pending uploads across app restarts

### AI Processing Failures Not Tracked

**Issue:** Failed AI processing requests were not properly tracked or retried.

**Solution:**
- Added AI processing status tracking in PendingUploadsManager
- Implemented specific retry logic for AI processing failures
- Created proper error handling and status updates for AI processing
- Added success/failure notifications for AI processing

## UI/UX Issues

### App Doesn't Return to Watch Face Automatically

**Issue:** After starting a recording, the app would stay on the recording screen, requiring manual exit.

**Solution:**
- Implemented auto-return to watch face when no interaction detected
- Added countdown timer before automatically returning to watch face
- Created user interaction detection to cancel auto-return
- Added visual countdown indicator

### Pending Uploads UI Layout Issues

**Issue:** Pending uploads screen had layout issues on round watch faces.

**Solution:**
- Redesigned UI with circular watch faces in mind
- Used more icons instead of text for better readability
- Implemented proper scrolling and item layout
- Added visual indicators for upload status

## File Management Issues

### Local Files Not Cleaned Up

**Issue:** Recordings were not being removed from the watch after successful upload.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper file cleanup after confirmed upload
- Added verification of upload success before deletion
- Created scan functionality to find orphaned files

### Local Files Not Added to Pending List

**Issue:** Files in the music directory were not automatically added to the pending list.

**Solution:**
- Implemented scan functionality for the local music directory
- Added UI button for manual scanning
- Created auto-discovery of recordings not in the pending list

## Network Issues

**Issue:** App couldn't handle network changes properly for retrying uploads.

**Solution:**
- Implemented NetworkMonitorService to track connectivity changes
- Added NetworkChangeReceiver to respond to system connectivity broadcasts
- Created automatic retry mechanisms when network becomes available
- Improved error handling for network-related failures

## Performance Issues

**Issue:** Battery drain during long recording sessions.

**Solution:**
- Optimized recording parameters for battery efficiency
- Implemented proper service lifecycle management
- Added conditional upload based on network type (WiFi preferred)
- Improved background processing efficiency

## Animation and Feedback Issues

**Issue:** Limited user feedback when actions are performed.

**Solution:**
- Added haptic feedback for important actions
- Implemented button animations for better visual feedback
- Improved notification clarity and visibility
- Enhanced UI state transitions

## Security Issues

**Issue:** Sensitive user data and files need protection.

**Solution:**
- Implemented secure storage for authentication tokens
- Used HTTPS for all network communications
- Added proper lifecycle handling for sensitive resources
- Implemented removal of temporary files
